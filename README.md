# PacBot

Code base for the iRobotics PacBot team through the 2019-2020 seasons. This robot is designed to navigate through an arena modeled after the classic Pac-Man level, and collect points while avoiding ghosts. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W in conjunction with an ESP32 to handle communication with game servers as well as sensor feedback and motor output. See our Instagram for examples of testing performance: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv3dMr6ljxp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
